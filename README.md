#### Key Features in the Redesign:  

1. **Add to Queue Button for Song Suggestions**:  
   - A dedicated **"Add to Queue"** button is now available on top of every song suggestion.  
   - This allows users to quickly queue songs without needing to navigate multiple menus.  

2. **Recents Section at the Top**:  
   - The **"Recents"** section is always displayed prominently at the top of the home screen.  
   - Users can easily access recently played tracks without needing to search or navigate to a separate dashboard.  

3. **Dark and Light Modes**:  
   - Introduced **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode** options, catering to users’ preferences for a comfortable visual experience across various lighting conditions.  
   - Users can toggle between modes from the settings menu or a quick-access button.  

4. **Repeat Feature Beside Player Controls**:  
   - The **Repeat** button has been relocated next to the **Speaker** and **Pause/Play** buttons for better accessibility.  
   - Users can activate repeat for a single song or the entire playlist with a single tap, streamlining their interaction with the player.  

5. **Enhanced UI/UX for Navigation**:  
   - Simplified navigation with a more organized home page to prioritize essential features like recommendations, queues, and playlists.  
   - Personalized suggestions are visually grouped, reducing cognitive overload.  

6. **Personalized Recommendations**:  
   - Improved AI-powered suggestions that are more relevant to user preferences.  
   - Integrated contextual details on why a song or playlist is recommended.
