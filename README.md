4. **Repeat Feature Beside Player Controls**:  
   - The **Repeat** button has been relocated next to the **Speaker** and **Pause/Play** buttons for better accessibility.  
   - Users can activate repeat for a single song or the entire playlist with a single tap, streamlining their interaction with the player.  

5. **Enhanced UI/UX for Navigation**:  
   - Simplified navigation with a more organized home page to prioritize essential features like recommendations, queues, and playlists.  
   - Personalized suggestions are visually grouped, reducing cognitive overload.  

6. **Personalized Recommendations**:  
   - Improved AI-powered suggestions that are more relevant to user preferences.  
   - Integrated contextual details on why a song or playlist is recommended.

7. **Voice Search for Songs**
   - Added a Voice Search feature that allows users to find songs by singing or speaking a part of the lyrics.
   - Utilizes advanced audio recognition to deliver accurate results and help users quickly find the desired track, even if they don't know the exact name.
